# Cross Break

This repository contains Unity 6 files for compiling a crossing game.

The game was created during a game jam among students, with the theme: "boom". Coincidentally, at the beginning of the class, a UPS burned out, so we created a game with the goal of catching UPSs in time, while the player has to dodge cars on the street. If the player doesn't catch the UPS, it explodes.

## Requirements
